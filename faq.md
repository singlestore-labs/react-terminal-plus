## Running tests

To run tests you might have to add both `react` and `react-dom` as `devDependencies` to your `package.json` file.

## How to Develop

Open 2 terminals side by side.

Terminal 1:

> yarn watch

Terminal 2:

> cd ./example && yarn start

---

## How to Publish

Run the following command: `npx np`.
