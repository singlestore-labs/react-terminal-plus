## Code of Conduct

This project contains a [Contributor Covenant code of conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) all contributors are expected to follow.

## Reporting Issues

Please do open an issue on the issue tracker if there's any bugfix, documentation improvement, or general enhancement you'd like to see in the repository! Please provide as much detail as possible in your issue report.

## Sending Contributions

Sending your own changes as contribution is always appreciated!
There are two steps involved:

1. [Finding an Issue](#finding-an-issue)
2. [Sending a Pull Request](#sending-a-pull-request)

### Finding an Issue

With the exception of very small typos, all changes to this repository generally need to correspond to an unassigned open issue.
If this is your first time contributing, consider searching for unassigned issues that also have the `good first issue` label.
If the issue you'd like to fix isn't found on the issue, see [Reporting Issues](#reporting-issues) for filing your own (please do!).

### Sending a Pull Request

Once you've identified an open issue accepting PRs that doesn't yet have a PR sent, you're free to send a pull request.

PRs are also expected to have a title that adheres to [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0).
Only PR titles need to be in that format, not individual commits.
Don't worry if you get this wrong: you can always change the PR title after sending it.
Check previously merged PRs for reference.
