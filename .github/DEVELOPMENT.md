# Development

```shell
git clone https://github.com/<your-name-here>/react-terminal-plus
cd react-terminal-plus
pnpm install
```

> This repository includes a list of suggested VS Code extensions.
> It's a good idea to use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) and accept its suggestion to install them, as they'll help with development.

Open a terminal and run:

```shell
pnpm run start

This allows for hot-reloading on the `example` app when performing changes on the `src` folder, which you can look at in the browser.

## Building

```shell
pnpm build
```

## Running tests

```shell
pnpm test
```

## How to Publish
